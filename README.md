# CreditRisk
Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp - Module 17 - Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk - In this module, I used Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning helps banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.

## What I Learned/Achieved:
- How to explain a machine learning algorithm's function in data analytics.
- How to create training and test groups from a given dataset.
- How to implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
- How to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
- How to determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given dataset or scenario.
- How to use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.
